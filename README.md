# New-Unix-Shell
—-Implemented by Hüseyin Mert Yenilmez—-

There are 2 C file. One of them is shell_with_input_txt.c and second one shell.c

shell_with_input;_txt.c reads and executes commands from input.txt

shell.c executes commands which you write

shell_with_input;_txt.c works with:

clang ~/shell_with_input_txt.c -o ~/shell_with_input_txt
./shell_with_input_txt.c shell ~/input.txt

shell.c works with:

clang ~/shell.c -o ~/shell
./shell.c

Also you can execute shell.c with just clicking compiled “shell” file.
